# Face-Detection
A simple computer vision project using OpenCV to detect human faces in images or live webcam feed. It uses a Haar Cascade Classifier or DNN model to locate faces, draw rectangles around them, and display the output in real-time. Great for beginners to learn image processing and AI basics.
