# Face-Detection
This project detects human faces 👤 in images 📷 or live webcam 🎥 video using Python 🐍 and OpenCV 👁️. It loads a pre-trained Haar Cascade model to find faces, draws green rectangles 🟩 around them, and shows the result in real-time ⚡. Perfect for beginners to explore computer vision 🤖 and a great base for attendance systems, security apps, or photo effects.



#  How to Use (Quick Guide)
📷 Webcam Mode: Just run python face_detect.py and look at the camera.

🖼️ Image Mode: Modify the code to read an image instead of webcam.
